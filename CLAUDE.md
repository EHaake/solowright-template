# Project Constitution

> **This is a template.** Every section below has placeholders and
> inline guidance comments (`<!-- like this -->`) — none of it is ready
> to use as-is. Fill in each section for the actual project before

> Claude Code nothing real to follow. See the skill's `README.md` (aka
> `How-To-Use.md` once distributed) for the full setup sequence this

This file is the standing contract for how this codebase is built. It loads
into every Claude Code session automatically. Specs and plans must not
contradict it; if a spec needs to, the constitution gets amended first,
explicitly, in its own commit.

## What this project is

<!-- One paragraph. What it is, who it's for, what the core loop is.
Write this once the first spec conversation has actually happened —
don't guess at it before then. -->

## Platform

<!-- Target platform/version, language, and any "no X unless Y" rules,
each with a one-line reason. Example shape:

- **Target**: [platform + minimum version]. [Back-compat policy.]
- **[UI framework, if any]**: [framework] only. No [alternative] except
  where [specific, narrow exception] — flagged when it happens, not a
  default.
- **Language**: [language + version]. [Concurrency/typing mode and why.] -->

## Architecture

<!-- Pattern (MVVM, MVC, whatever), and the actual rules that make it
real rather than aspirational — what layer owns what, what's forbidden
from importing what, how dependencies get injected for testability. -->

## Testing

<!-- Framework, and the real requirements:
- What needs tests, and what the fake/mock boundary is.
- "A task is not done until tests exist and pass — run the command
  yourself, don't assert completion from reading the code."
- Leave room here to add principles as they're discovered — this
  section should grow over the project's life, not stay static. See
  the parent skill's "Principles worth generalizing" section for the
  kind of thing that belongs here once found. -->

## Dependencies

<!-- Default policy (e.g. "no third-party packages without discussion")
and why. -->

## Project file safety

<!-- If there's a project-format file that agents reliably mishandle
(Xcode's .pbxproj is the classic example — a semi-binary format that's
easy to corrupt with a direct edit), name it explicitly and state the
safe path around it. -->

## Spec-driven workflow

This project follows spec → plan → tasks → implement, gated by human
review between each phase. Artifacts live in `specs/<NNN>-<slug>/`:

- `spec.md` — what and why, user-facing behavior, acceptance criteria,
  explicit non-goals. No implementation detail.
- `plan.md` — technical design: types, data flow, what changes where.
- `tasks.md` — ordered, small, independently verifiable tasks.

Do not begin implementation on a feature without an approved spec and
plan in that feature's directory. When resuming a session, check
`specs/<feature>/tasks.md` for current state before doing anything else.

`spec.md` and `plan.md` get authored in a chat-based design conversation,
not in this session — if asked to scope a brand-new feature from
scratch, point back to that conversation rather than drafting them
inline here. This session's job starts once they already exist and are
approved.

## Collaboration workflow

If the `spec-driven-development` skill is installed
(`~/.claude/skills/spec-driven-development/` or a project-level
`.claude/skills/`), its collaboration workflow applies automatically —
routine tasks proceed normally, real decisions resolve via Plan Mode and
the `skeptical-reviewer` subagent, and the person is looped in only when
something in the design turns out infeasible or needs real rework, or a
previously-unknown consideration surfaces that would materially change
the project's direction. Nothing needs to be repeated here.

<!-- Add project-specific refinements only if this project's escalation
criteria genuinely differ from the skill's default — a different risk
tolerance, a different definition of "foundational" for this particular
codebase. Most projects won't need anything here at all; the one case
this project came from needed a hand-written version only because the
skill didn't exist yet at the time. -->

## Verification

After any implementation task, Claude Code must:

1. Build the project.
2. Run the test suite.
3. Report the actual pass/fail output, not a paraphrase.

A task is not complete until steps 1–2 are green. Do not weaken, skip, or
delete a test to make it pass — if a test seems wrong, flag it and ask.

## Git conventions

- **One branch per spec, not per task or phase.**
- **Never commit directly to `main`.** All implementation work happens
  on a spec branch.
- Open the PR as a draft immediately after pushing the branch, for a
  running diff. Only mark it ready and merge once every task in the
  spec's `tasks.md` is complete and verified.
- Keep AI co-authorship attribution on commits — accurate, and worth
  keeping for a project meant to demonstrate this workflow.
- Never force-push.

## Commits

- One commit per completed task where practical, referencing the task ID.
- Commit messages describe what changed and why, not "implement task 3".
